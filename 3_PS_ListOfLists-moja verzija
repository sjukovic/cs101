# Define a procedure, total_enrollment,
# that takes as an input a list of elements,
# where each element is a list containing
# three elements: a university name,
# the total number of students enrolled,
# and the annual tuition fees.

# The procedure should return two numbers,
# not a string, 
# giving the total number of students
# enrolled at all of the universities
# in the list, and the total tuition fees
# (which is the sum of the number
# of students enrolled times the
# tuition fees for each university).
